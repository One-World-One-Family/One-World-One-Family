### Introduction

OWOF is an idea playground to discuss, implement and contribute to ideas which can help include and empower people who do not get as much support from the society or face any kind of mental or physical disabilities. 

In this organisation there are various ongoing projects to which someone can contribute or add ideas to the idea list so that they can be picked up and added to ongoing projects. 

### Procedure

Anyone is welcome to contribute to any of the repositories. 

**Steps**

1. Just raise a PR to add yourself into the contributor list on the primer page.
2.  You can either contribute to solve an issue reported or you can create a PR for a feature addition into the specific repository of the idea from the ongoing project list and a maintainer will merge it. 
3. You can also add new ideas to the idea list if you think they can be helpful to anyone.  
4. Contribution to the Primer is also welcomed if you feel we can add more important things for instance events, conferences, posts etc.  The procedure is same by just raising a PR in the idea list. 

The idea list is reviewed every 15 days with contributors  on our Zulip channel  and  new projects are added if someone wants to contribute to it.
